## This diary contains a daily log of what I have learned while coding. 

#### The date format for this log is MM-DD-YYYY

5/13/2021 - Learned how to declare variables so that setters and getters can work to properly be able to instantiate the class. Instantiated a student in the Student class with my name, the number of credits and GPA.

05/12/2021 - Spent today learning about Java Arraylists that store HashMap objects which have a String of keys and a String of values. I am not quite printing the correct thing to the console yet. 

05/11/2021 - This is my very first entry to the Dev-Diary.
